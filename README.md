# React + AVA = ❤️

Find slides [here](http://kcd.im/react-ava)

This is a workshop for learning how to use the [ava](https://npmjs.org/package/ava)
testing framework with [React](https://npmjs.org/package/react).

The `master` branch (what you're looking at now) is the finished version.
If you'd like to follow along the [INSTRUCTIONS.md](blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md),
then check out the branch called `start`.

Good luck!
