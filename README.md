# React + AVA = ❤️

Find slides [here](http://kcd.im/react-ava)

This is a workshop for learning how to use the [ava](https://npmjs.org/package/ava)
testing framework with [React](https://npmjs.org/package/react).

There are branches for setting up your environment, and then there are branches for
actually getting the tests written. These are prefixed with `steps/`. Check these
out and look at the instructions in each of the test files in the project.

Good luck!
