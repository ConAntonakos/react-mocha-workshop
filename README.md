# React + AVA = ❤️

This is a workshop for learning how to use the [ava](https://npmjs.org/package/ava)
testing framework with [React](https://npmjs.org/package/react).

There are a few branches for getting the environment set up. Start with the first
branch and work your way through the other branches. Once the environment is set up,
go through the `practice` folder and follow the instructions. If you get stuck,
all of the tests are implemented in the `complete` folder.

Good luck!
